OK so this is working now. You need to drop this directory into your content directory (not sure where that is on mac).

The reason the movement wasn't working was due to incompatible animation sets so I moved the speed config over to BPdemo1.

I also added a nice little sprint speedboost to make BB feel a bit faster. 

In order to implement search for the following in the Information directory of CompleteRPG.
Replace the following files when you find them

1. DT_Speed - controls the speed data for the main character

2. E_WalkState - controls movement speed catagories. I have added a HogRun category. 

Once that's done you should just be able to run it. Shift is sprint. I think it may need to be faster. LMK. 
(for some unknown reason walk is set to the default movement speed and I cannot find it for the life of me.)
